Emoticam client-side app

[Emoticam](//www.emoticam.net) is a program that ran (consensually) in the background on a bunch of personal computers, from 2013-2018.
Anytime a user types something to imply theyâ€™re emoting in real life, it takes a photo of their face and uploads it to the project page (and formerly to Twitter).

This is the client-side app.

Requires [PhotoGrabber.h](https://gist.github.com/erkie/1038480), by Erik Rothoff Andersson
