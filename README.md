Emoticam client-side app

[Emoticam](//www.emoticam.net) is a program that ran (consensually) in the background on a bunch of personal computers, from 2013-2018.
Anytime a user typed something to imply they were emoting in real life, it took a photo of their face and uploaded it to the project page (and formerly to Twitter).

This is the client-side app.

Requires [PhotoGrabber.h](https://gist.github.com/erkie/1038480), by Erik Rothoff Andersson

[The server code can be found here](https://github.com/dansakamoto/emoticam-server).

Note: there was an issue with certain Mac models purchased after the project began which caused some of the images to be underexposed. This is the reason why there are so many solid black images in the later years.
